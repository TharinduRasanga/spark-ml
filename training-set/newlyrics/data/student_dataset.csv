with this rappity brat packin' a mac in the back of the ac' backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce   'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like ι have got   well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mcs get taken to school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz pac nwa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet rundmc induct them into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin' little gaylookin' boy so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy haha you're witnessin' a massoccur like you're watching a church gathering take place lookin' boy oy vey that boy's gaythat's all they say lookin' boy you get a thumbs up pat on the back and a way to go from your label every day lookin' boy hey lookin' boy what you say lookin' boy i get a hell yeah from dre lookin' boy i'ma work for everything i have never asked nobody for shit get outta my face lookin' boy basically boy you're never gonna be capable of keepin' up with the same pace lookin' boy 'cause   i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod the way i'm racin' around the track call me nascar nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's kryptonno asgard asgard   so you'll be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omnipotent let off then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god

fuckin' face right now yeah  verse let me explain just how to make greatness straight out the gate i'm bout to break it down ain't no mistakes allowed but make no mistake i'm 'bout to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows if i press the issue just to get the anger out brrr full magazine could take staples out savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account but bitch i'm off the chain like kala brown motherfucker shut the fuck up when im talkin lil' bitch im sorry wait what's your talent oh critiquin' my talent oh bitch i don't know who the fuck yall are to give a subpar bar or

reviews to get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse don't get misconstrued business as us' shitlist renewed so get shit to do or get dissed 'cause i just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow everyone copies though prob'ly no get this fuckin' audio out my audi yo adiós i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though not even dissin' it just ain't for me all i am simply is just an emcee maybe stan just isn't your cup of tea get it maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean maybe i need to stir up shit preferably shake the world up if it were up to me paul wants me to chill y'all want me to ill i should eat a pill probably i will old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death i breathe on the mirror i don't see my breath possibly i'm dead i must be possessed like an evil spell i'm evil evil spelled jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch like vice president mike pence back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and jesus christ man how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick you won't ever see em icy but as cold as i get on the mic i polarize shit so the thames might freeze and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah turn down for what i ain't loud enough nah turn the valium up illa illa illa 'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut now when it doesn't matter what caliber i spit at i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll turn around and just be like man how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu but last week an exfan mailed me a copy of the mathers lp to tell me to study it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me ooouuu i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg' azae' lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name i'm fed up with bein' humble and rumor is i'm hungry i'm sure you heard rumblings i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbojumbo the era that i'm from will pummel you that's what it's comin' to what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two and dump on you if you ain't joyner if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i don't see why y'all even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased i'm east side never be caught slippin' now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i don't blink i don't doze off i don't even nod to the beats i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage the thing ain't even orangeoh my god that's a reach shout to all my colorblind people each and everyone of y'all if you call a fire engine green aquamarine or you think water is pink dawg that's a date  looks like an olive to me look there's an apple  no it's not it's a peach so fingerbang pootie tang burger king gucci gang dookie dang charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesn't matter what i say give me donkey of the day what a way for 08 to get underway but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah invite 'em in like a one a day i'm not done preach 'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they've been puttin' me through the ringer so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners

like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house see it's sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk and here's your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it we're in a car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey here's a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy how's this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this you'll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near hope we don't get stopped no license i fear that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver's side mirror oh god police aaaghh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the  ha ha big bro it's for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again  part  produced by streetrunner  4 i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off

47,Eminem,Untouchable,Revival,2017,2017-12-08,pt i   hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you won't loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist 'ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin' this starspangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build

through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i can hear the drummer drummin' and the trumpets someone's tryna summon someone i know something's comin' but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin' get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin' i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are countin' me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin' i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause you're moving onto the next but is your respect gone cause someone told me that   gwen stefani kings never die   eminem don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldn't even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged why am i online it's driving me crazy i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge on what's hot but i'm not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage they so want a champion to fall it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just don't mean jack anymore if i'm here today and gone tomorrow and i'm not gonna be   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i want it i'm comin' to get it so you son of a

stop for no one i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that blocks your road ya knock it over time to go for the pot of gold cause   eminem they say kings never die just ask jam master jay they just grow wings and they fly so hands up reach for the sky try to hold on and prolong these moments cause in a blink of an eye they'll be over  4 eminem so you're tryna secure your legacy like shakur
